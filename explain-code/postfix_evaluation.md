1. I had worked on a lot of python code, but had never started a project from scratch, and some learnings from it.
* Put __init__.py in the directory you want to be considered as modules and import them in other places of your python code.
* Append the main directory of the project to PYTHONPATH. This can be in ~/.bashrc or can be done only for session.
* To reload bashrc after the changes I used source and learnt that source in bash basically executes anything in the file passed as argument to it Ex: source ~/.bashrc
* Learnt to use optparse for parsing the command-line arguments.
